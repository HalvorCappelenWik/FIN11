comic book analogies are obviously imperfect, to say the least. just because george soros can bend metal using his mind doesnât mean heâs magneto!!

also, while i am very much in favor of expanding legal immigration, we must have some vetting of who comes in, so that we do not allow dangerous felons to prey upon innocent americans.",0,2023-05-18 15:26:03
