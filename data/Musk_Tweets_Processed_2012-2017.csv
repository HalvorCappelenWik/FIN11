2016-08-31 18:23:36,Major improvements to Autopilot coming with V8.0 and 8.1 software (std OTA update) primarily through advanced processing of radar signals
2016-08-31 18:25:12,Writing post now with details. Will publish on Tesla website later today.
2016-08-31 18:27:35,We need to do one more minor rev on 8.0 and then will go to wide release in a few weeks
2016-08-31 18:43:00,"@Lockyep Not allowed, according to HK regulations. Happy to do it if regs change."
2016-09-01 20:07:54,Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.

2016-09-09 10:38:53,Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
2016-09-09 10:39:46,Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
2016-09-09 10:46:43,"Support & advice from @NASA, @FAA, @AFPAA & others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report@spacex.com."
2016-09-09 10:53:54,Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
