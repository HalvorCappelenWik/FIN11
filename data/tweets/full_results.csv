comic book analogies are obviously imperfect, to say the least. just because george soros can bend metal using his mind doesnâÄôt mean heâÄôs magneto!!

anyway, my actual concern with soros is that he has funded so many politicians & das who are soft even on violent crime, which has caused great damage to many cities imo.

also, while i am very much in favor of expanding legal immigration, we must have some vetting of who comes in, so that we do not allow dangerous felons to prey upon innocent americans.";0
