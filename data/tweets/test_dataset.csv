anyway, my actual concern with soros is that he has funded so many politicians & das who are soft even on violent crime, which has caused great damage to many cities imo.

also, while i am very much in favor of expanding legal immigration, we must have some vetting of who comes in, so that we do not allow dangerous felons to prey upon innocent americans."
