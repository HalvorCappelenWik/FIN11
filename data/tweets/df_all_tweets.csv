2018-05-04 07:35:25-04:00,"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
2018-05-04 07:55:43-04:00,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
2018-05-04 08:04:51-04:00,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
2018-05-04 08:21:20-04:00,"@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."

2018-05-20 02:31:40-04:00,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; donât get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
2018-05-20 02:34:02-04:00,@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!

If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
2018-05-21 21:33:27-04:00,"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3âs having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
2018-05-21 21:38:09-04:00,"@LanceUlanoff The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3âs have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time weâve seen anything like this."

2018-05-21 23:07:08-04:00,"@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"

2018-05-22 00:07:16-04:00,"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla wonât stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
2018-05-22 00:10:25-04:00,"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."

2018-05-22 00:17:10-04:00,"@samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Todayâs Model S is far more refined than initial production."
2018-05-22 00:20:51-04:00,"@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."

2018-12-19 14:09:16-05:00,Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
2018-12-19 14:15:09-05:00,"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety."
2018-12-19 14:19:29-05:00,"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy"
2018-12-19 14:23:31-05:00,@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.

2018-12-19 14:27:44-05:00,"@FredericLambert @boringcompany Youâre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didnât include it. Weâre working on one that makes things clear."
2018-12-19 14:31:55-05:00,"@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think theyâre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
2018-12-19 14:34:07-05:00,"@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
2018-12-19 14:36:27-05:00,"@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
2018-12-19 14:39:37-05:00,"@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."

2021-06-13 13:21:58-04:00,"@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. 

Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator."
2021-06-13 13:27:59-04:00,"@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). 

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration."

2023-02-12 01:45:14-05:00,"Long day at Twitter HQ with eng team

Two significant problems mostly addressed:

1. Fanout service for Following feed was getting overloaded when I tweeted, resulting in up to 95% of my tweets not getting delivered at all. Following is now pulling from search (aka Earlybird). When Fanout crashed, it would also destroy anyone elseâs tweets in queue.

2. Recommendation algorithm was using absolute block count, rather than percentile block count, causing accounts with many followers to be dumped, even if blocks were only 0.1% of followers. Also, itâs trivial to bot spam accounts with blocks."

The biggest problem is that Twitter optimized for impressions over clicks, with the perverse result that it *maximized* ad irrelevance, because clicking on an ad takes you away from Twitter, thus reducing impressions generated per user-minute. ð¤¯ð¤¯

2023-02-24 17:47:08-05:00,"Ralph Nader, you are lying â shame on you! I personally provided almost all Tesla funding, based on my proceeds from PayPal, from Series A in 2004 until Series C in 2007.

In late 2008, I gave Tesla the last money I had. It was that or the company would have died. We closed that funding round at 6pm on Christmas Eve. 

If we had not closed that round, Tesla would have gone bankrupt 2 days after Christmas. I gave my last money thinking Tesla would probably still die, not thinking that it would be lucrative.

The first meaningful government funding Tesla received was in Q2 2010 from a loan under the vehicle efficiency lending program. Tesla paid back that loan early with interest. Taxpayers actually made a profit.

Just as with alcohol prohibition, people didnât actually stop drinking, but they did start drinking badly made alcohol (Moonshine), which could be poisonous, depending on how it was made and what contaminants were present. 

The strength of Fentanyl means that even a small dosage increase can be fatal. People are rarely trying to commit suicide, but they can easily inadvertently take too much. Therefore, it seems likely to me that pharma-grade quality and precise dosage will dramatically reduce deaths.

A limited time and location test of this policy is worth trying, as our current approach is failing badly."

2023-04-26 12:25:48-04:00,"The Swedish study says âsex-reassigned transsexual persons of both genders had approximately a three times higher risk of all-cause mortality than controlsâ. 

If we take as given that the other study 2-3X suicide rate is correct, then doing surgery or chemical sterilization on minors gains nothing in reduced mortality.

My position is simply that we should wait until an individual is mature enough to make their own decisions before other adults make permanent, serious physical changes to them.

The counter to my position would be that if we donât make the changes when theyâre a minor, they may never reach adulthood due to suicide. However, that counterargument does not hold water if mortality is essentially unchanged, which it is. 

Btw, I regard cisgender as a slur."

2023-05-06 18:09:36-04:00,"I grew up in a lower, transitioning to upper, middle income situation, but did not have a happy childhood. Havenât inherited anything ever from anyone, nor has anyone given me a large financial gift.

My father created a small electrical/mechanical engineering company that was successful for 20 to 30 years, but it fell on hard times. He has been essentially bankrupt for about 25 years, requiring financial support from my brother and me. 

That said, he does deserve credit for teaching me the fundamentals of physics, engineering and construction, which is more valuable than money, but did not support me financially after high school in any meaningful way.

Our condition of providing him financial support was that he not engage in bad behavior. Unfortunately, he nonetheless did. There are young children involved, so we continued to provide financial support for their well-being.

Regarding the so-called âemerald mineâ, there is no objective evidence whatsoever that this mine ever existed. He told me that he owned a share in a mine in Zambia, and I believed him for a while, but nobody has ever seen the mine, nor are there any records of its existence.

2023-05-17 00:26:13-04:00,"Perfectly said. Among other things,  Soros astutely identified a massive arbitrage opportunity in district attorney elections, where a relatively small amount of money has outsized influence. 

Sorosâs instructions to his pet prosecutors were (essentially) to minimize prosecuting even violent criminals.

Thatâs why a criminal â someone who had already stabbed his roommate â could brutally assault Dave Chapelle on stage with that same deadly weapon and yet receive merely a misdemeanor!"

2023-05-18 15:26:03-04:00,"In fairness, I must concede that Joel has a good point and I will endeavor to be more thoughtful in the future.

Comic book analogies are obviously imperfect, to say the least. Just because George Soros can bend metal using his mind doesnât mean heâs Magneto!!

Anyway, my actual concern with Soros is that he has funded so many politicians & DAs who are soft even on violent crime, which has caused great damage to many cities imo.

Also, while I am very much in favor of expanding legal immigration, we must have some vetting of who comes in, so that we do not allow dangerous felons to prey upon innocent Americans."

Second, I think there is tremendous promise in synthetic mRNA. It is like medicine going from analog to digital.

That said, the world obviously went crazy with excess vaccination against âCovid-19â. I have that in quotes, because the RNA sequences changed so much that I called it the virus of Theseus. 

So many people I know had serious side effects from the vaccines, including myself. Failure to acknowledge that is a lie.

Do I think vaccines should be examined closely & mortality risk isnât substantially reduced in America? Yes. 

However, you should definitely take vaccines if traveling to places where that disease is prevalent!

Do I think you should take most vaccines even if you never leave America? Also yes. The benefit may be small, but the risk is much smaller."
