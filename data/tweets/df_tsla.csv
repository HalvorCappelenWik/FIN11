2018-05-22 00:10:25-04:00,"@electrekco @fredericlambert also, consumer reports has an early production car. model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. will request that they test current production."

2018-06-17 12:43:57-04:00,"@doctorow iain certainly wasnât pro-union in the culture books. at all. and wouldnât be in the case of tesla. banks was about freedom through &amp; through. maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), i would be too, but thatâs a special case."
2018-06-17 13:00:07-04:00,"@thesithseth @doctorow iâm not against all unions, but uaw has a track record of destroying productivity so a company canât compete on world market. our current factory went bankrupt under uaw before we took it over. donât want tesla to die too."
2018-06-17 13:16:19-04:00,"@dimas_______ @robotbeat @doctorow uaw doesnât have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. they canât even muster enough people for a free bbq. instead, theyâre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. such creeps."
2018-06-17 13:31:00-04:00,"@doctorow i endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel tesla is a good company. uaw has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
2018-06-17 13:40:58-04:00,@teslacharts how big is your short position? just curious.
2018-06-17 13:44:19-04:00,@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @robotbeat @doctorow more propaganda. the nda only prevents disclosure of tesla proprietary ip or material non-public information (insider trading).
2018-06-17 13:49:38-04:00,"@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesnât work. uaw and wall street shorts know every detail of whatâs happening at tesla. storm clouds are gathering, so theyâre getting desperate."

2018-06-17 16:19:10-04:00,"@goombar3 weâve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; tesla stock. also, free drinks &amp; snacks. try to make it fun too. top ten hourly workers cumulatively received tesla stock now worth $1m to $2m. nobody wants uaw, so uaw keeps trashing tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties."
2018-06-18 19:53:58-04:00,"@cfarivar @amendlocke dude, we are california, which is extremely pro union. people can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing tesla could do to stop it. uaw canât even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer."

in late 2008, i gave tesla the last money i had. it was that or the company would have died. we closed that funding round at 6pm on christmas eve. 

if we had not closed that round, tesla would have gone bankrupt 2 days after christmas. i gave my last money thinking tesla would probably still die, not thinking that it would be lucrative.

the first meaningful government funding tesla received was in q2 2010 from a loan under the vehicle efficiency lending program. tesla paid back that loan early with interest. taxpayers actually made a profit.
