2020-02-07 03:31:23,"@teslarati this isnât quite correct. an orbital rocket needs precision thatâs 3x to 4x better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. suborbital is much more forgiving."
2020-02-07 03:35:55,"@teslarati that said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because itâs built inside a factory in volume."
2020-02-07 03:45:02,"@chraveesh @teslarati yes, weâre tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area"

2020-02-07 07:52:53,"@teslarati @13ericralph31 unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for sn1 orbital design. optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter."

- tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our shanghai factory.

- a monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100x too low. maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?"

in late 2008, i gave tesla the last money i had. it was that or the company would have died. we closed that funding round at 6pm on christmas eve. 

if we had not closed that round, tesla would have gone bankrupt 2 days after christmas. i gave my last money thinking tesla would probably still die, not thinking that it would be lucrative.

the first meaningful government funding tesla received was in q2 2010 from a loan under the vehicle efficiency lending program. tesla paid back that loan early with interest. taxpayers actually made a profit.
